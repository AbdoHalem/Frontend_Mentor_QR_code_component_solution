## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox (used for centering the card)
- Google Fonts (Outfit)

### What I learned

In this project, I practiced how to center a component perfectly in the middle of the screen using CSS Flexbox. I also learned about using relative units and managing images within a card.

Here is the CSS snippet I used to center the card:

```css
body {
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
    margin: 0;
}
